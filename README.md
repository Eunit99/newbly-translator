# newbly_jquery

This is a jQuery based javascript plugin that shall be included into any website, and insert translations of the main content of that website.

The way this should work:

On a specific set of websites (e.g. news outlets), the plugin shall find text parts on a website given by an api, and then copy those html containers containing these texts and replacing the text of the copied text with the translated version of it.

In the end, all paragraphs of an article shall have the translated version of it underneath.

## How to use

- Put the link to the script (`/js/script.js`) on the page
